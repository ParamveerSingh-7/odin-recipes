<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  When you think about cool, contemporary desserts taking the food world by
  storm, there are two words that likely don't come to mind: soft serve. As in,
  soft serve ice cream. But while we were busy marveling at gooey-centered
  molten chocolate cake – and while molecular gastronomists were whipping ice
  cream over liquid nitrogen – soft serve ice cream was making a serious
  comeback, in New York, LA, Portland, and beyond. Here's more on the trend –
  and two easy ways to make your own soft serve at home.
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 pound strawberries</li>
  <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
  <li>1/4 cup light corn syrup</li>
  <li>1/3 cup water</li>
  <li>
    1/8 tsp xanthan gum (a natural stablizer that's easy to find at specialty
    supermarkets)
  </li>
  <li>1 cupcoconut cream</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Remove the green tops from the strawberries and slice them into perfect
    slices. Toss the berries in sugar until they are completely coated and cook
    in a 350-degree oven until they are perfectly cooked, slightly caramelized,
    and overwhelmingly aromatic, about 10 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove the strawberries from the oven and allow to cool to room temp. Once
    the berries are cooled, puree them really well with a blender. Pass the
    berries through a fine mesh strainer to get out most of the remaining pulp
    and seeds.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir together about one fourth of the sugar with all of the xanthan gum in a
    small bowl. Pour the water in a small saucepan, add the sugar mixture and
    immediately whisk vigorously until very smooth
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer the soft serve base into an airtight container and refrigerate
    until well chilled, about four hours, or, for even better texture and
    flavor, 24 hours.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pour the soft serve base into a standard at-home ice cream maker and turn on
    the machine. Churn just until the mixture has the desired texture of soft
    serve, about 15 to 25 minutes depending on the machine.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a spatula to scoop all of the ice cream into a piping bag and pipe the
    ice cream out into a cone! This soft serve could be stored, covered, in the
    freezer for up to two weeks but should be very tediously tempered before
    eating after being frozen.
  </li>
